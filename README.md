# Arvato-Customer-Segmentation-Udacity-Capstone

## Motivation:
Bank Arvato want to increase understanding of their customers in order to improve efficiency of their mail out processes.
In order do this, this project:
- developed a segmentation model to understand how the company's customer base differed from the general population
- developed a predictive model to identify customers who are most likely to respond to a mailout
- evaluated the effectiveness of the predictive model

Results were uploaded to Kaggle to compare model accuracy vs similar attempts: https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-arvato-identify-customers
A blog post was created to summarise the results: https://medium.com/@phoebe.macdonald/who-are-arvato-banks-most-valuable-customers-7504f6bf3c77
